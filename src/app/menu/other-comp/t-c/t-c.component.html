                            Please note that not all matches will have all the slots available. To check the listing of all available slots in the match, you can check the availability of the same on MyTeam11 application, as you select the match.

                            The 2nd Innings contest will be activated after the full match category is closed. Users will be allowed to create teams and join contests for LIVE fantasy, once the full match category is closed.

                                If any two or more referrers have referred the same number of users, then the referrer with the most number of users that have played paid contests will be considered higher in leaderboard ranking. For instance, user A and user B have referred 150 users on MyTeam11. If the number of referees/friends of user A who have played paid contests is 79 while the number of referees of user B who have played paid contests is 76, then user A will stand at a higher ranking than user B.

                                If referrers refer the same number of users on MyTeam11 with the same number of referees who have played paid contests, then the winnings of the same ranking and the rank below will be split in two between two referrers. For example, User A and User B both have referred 100 people and out of those 50 referees have played paid contests, then User A and User B will stand at ranks 3 & 4 where the prize amount (worth the prize at rank 3 & 4) will be distributed equally to both users.
